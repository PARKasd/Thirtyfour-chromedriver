# ðŸ¦€ Rust + Thirtyfour: Auto ChromeDriver Installer

This Rust project automatically downloads the correct version of ChromeDriver based on the version of Chrome installed on your system. It uses the [`thirtyfour`](https://crates.io/crates/thirtyfour) crate for WebDriver automation, and integrates tools to fetch, unzip, and launch the matching driver.
I'm newbie in Rust so code is dirty.
## ðŸš€ Features

- Detect installed Chrome version (cross-platform support)
- Automatically download the matching ChromeDriver
- Unzip and configure the driver binary
- Launch Chrome using [`thirtyfour`](https://crates.io/crates/thirtyfour)
